There are 70+ Ajax patterns here, most linking to the original draft version for the design patterns book. Foundational Technology Patterns are lower-level patterns and a suitable introduction for people learning Ajax for the first time. Programming Patterns explain how these components are combined in a maintainable, performant, manner. Functionality and Usability Patterns guide on user-interface and usability concepts. Development Process Patterns look at typical developer activities like testing and debugging.
