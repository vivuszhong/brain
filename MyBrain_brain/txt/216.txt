	Current release
06-10-2012: Mockito 1.9.5 released! See the release notes. Should appear in maven central shortly. 

Why drink it?
Mockito is a mocking framework that tastes really good. It lets you write beautiful tests with clean & simple API. Mockito doesn't give you hangover because the tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors. Read more about features & motivations. 
     
"We decided during the main conference that we should use JUnit 4 and Mockito because we think they are the future of TDD and mocking in Java" - Dan North, the originator of BDD

How do I drink it?
Download mockito-all-x.x.x.jar and put it on the classpath. If you use a fancy build system with declarative dependencies like Gradle or Maven please -> Click HERE <- 
Then you can verify interactions:

Or stub method calls

Who is your bartender?
Mockito is served to you by Szczepan Faber and friends. First people who tried Mockito were developers of the Guardian project in London in early 2008. Here is how Szczepan explained why we need another mocking framework? 
Firstly, hats down before EasyMock folks for their ideas on beautiful and refactorable mocking syntax. First hacks on Mockito were done on top of the EasyMock code. 
Here are just some of my friends who contributed ideas to Mockito (apologize if I missed somebody): Igor Czechowski, Patric Fornasier, Jim Barritt, Felix Leipold, Liz Keogh, Bartosz Bańkowski 
Special thanks to Steve Christou for setting up the continuous builds at his Hudson server. Previously, Erik Ramfelt hosted Mockito builds for a couple of years (big thanks!). 
Thanks to Karol Poźniak for the logo (and a decent web page in future, hopefully :) 
Finally, thanks to Erik Brakkee and Igor Czechowski for helping out with maven central stuff. 
Thanks to YourKit for the profiler!
