Introduction
Apache Qpid™ is a cross-platform Enterprise Messaging system which implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), providing message brokers written in C++ and Java, along with clients for C++, Java JMS, .Net, Python, and Ruby.
Enterprise Messaging systems let programs communicate by exchanging messages, much as people communicate by exchanging email. Unlike email, enterprise messaging systems provide guaranteed delivery, speed, security, and freedom from spam. Until recently, there was no open standard for Enterprise Messaging systems, so programmers either wrote their own, or used expensive proprietary systems.
AMQP is the first open standard for Enterprise Messaging. It is designed to support messaging for just about any distributed or business application. Routing can be configured flexibly, easily supporting common messaging paradigms like point-to-point, fanout, publish-subscribe, and request-response.
Apache Qpid implements the latest AMQP specification, providing transaction management, queuing, distribution, security, management, clustering, federation and heterogeneous multi-platform support and a lot more. And Apache Qpid is extremely fast. Apache Qpid aims to be 100% AMQP Compliant.
This is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.
