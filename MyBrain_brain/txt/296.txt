  *  Java bytecode: Understanding bytecode makes you a better programmer 
     This article gives you an understanding of Java bytecode that will enable you to be a better programmer. Java programmers should take the time to understand what the bytecode is, how it works, and most importantly, what bytecode is being generated by the Java compiler. In some cases, the bytecode generated is not what you expect!
