Ehcache: Java's Most Widely-Used Cache
Ehcache is an open source, standards-based cache for boosting performance, offloading your database, and simplifying scalability. It's the most widely-used Java-based cache because it's robust, proven, and full-featured. Ehcache scales from in-process, with one or more nodes, all the way to mixed in-process/out-of-process configurations with terabyte-sized caches.
Terracotta actively develops, maintains, and supports Ehcache as a professional open source project available under an Apache 2 license. In addition to the open source Ehcache edition, Terracotta offers BigMemory for enterprise-grade in-memory data management with high availability, worldwide 24x7 professional support, consulting, and training services.
For applications requiring a coherent distributed cache, use Terracotta BigMemory Max, which is available in both free and full versions. (Terracotta no longer actively updates the open-source version of Terracotta Server Array, also known as Terracotta. However, you can still download the latest open-source version of Terrcotta Server Array.)
BigMemory for Ehcache
All Your Data in Memory—Without Garbage Collection Pauses
Ready to create very large in-memory data stores—without worrying about garbage collection performance hits or time-consuming tuning? BigMemory extends Ehcache's' capabilities with an off-heap store that frees you from GC’s constraints. BigMemory uses the Ehcache API for reading and writing, so it's a snap to add to any Ehcache deployment. You also get a search API, advanced in-memory monitoring and management tools, disk-backed, fast restartability, and much more. 
BigMemory Go—with 32GB free

Ehcache Search
Query, Search and Analyze In-Memory Data
Ehcache Search is an addition to the core Ehcache API that lets you query, search and analyze billions of cache entries in memory, with results to complex searches returned in less than a second. By querying the cache directly, you can avoid the time-consuming and expensive process of querying the database, then mapping query results to cache lookups.
