Querydsl
Querydsl is a framework which enables the construction of type-safe SQL-like queries for multiple backends including JPA, MongoDB and SQL in Java.
Example for JPA:

List<Customer> result = query.from(customer)
    .where(customer.lastName.like("A%"), customer.active.eq(true))
    .orderBy(customer.lastName.asc(), customer.firstName.desc())
    .list(customer);    
Compared to the alternatives Querydsl is more compact, safer and easier to learn. Try it today!
Introduction video:
Instead of writing queries as inline strings or externalizing them into XML files they are constructed via a fluent API.
  •  Code completion in IDE (all properties, methods and operations can be expanded in your favorite Java IDE)
  •  Almost no syntactically invalid queries allowed (type-safe on all levels)
  •  Domain types and properties can be referenced safely (no Strings involved!)
  •  Adopts better to refactoring changes in domain types
  •  Incremental query definition is easier
Since 2.3.0 Querydsl is released under the Apache License, version 2.0.
Releases before 2.3.0 are licensed under the LGPL 2.1 license.
